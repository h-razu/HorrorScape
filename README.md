# ***HorrorScape***
In ***Horrorscape***, we tried to create a simple horror
arcade game, conceived and constructed using the combined
capabilities of Three.js and Box2D. Within this interactive maze,
the player is put into dynamically generated mazes where they
race against time. Navigating the gameâ€™s intricacies necessitates
a mastery of physics-driven ball movement, as players strive to
complete levels within certain time limits. This project stands as a
collaboration between Three.js and Box2D in crafting captivating
and suspenseful gameplay. It caters to the enthusiasts of horror
arcade experiences, providing a unique blend of challenge and
immersion.

To develop our game, we utilized Three.js and Box2D. Three.js was used for creating objects such as bricks for the maze, ball objects, and other elements. On the other hand, Box2D assisted in performing constrained body simulations and collision detection. The implementation primarily focused on time-related tasks
and maze navigation, resulting in a gameplay experience that
combines strategy, reflexes, and suspense.

**Some Implemented Features:**\
**A**. *Randomly Generated Maze.*\
**B**. *Physics Simulation with Box2D.*\
**C**. *Time-Constraint Gameplay.*
